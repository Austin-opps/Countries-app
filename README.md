# Countries app
This is an app which gives details about a country.

# Data
The app uses a REST API: Countruies, to provide the countries info.
"https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{name}?fullText=true" 

# Running of the app
The app displays the language that  a country speaks, which continent it belongs to and the currency that it uses.

This is how it will look like:

when a user mispells a country the app tells the user that ""countryName" does not exist. try again!":
